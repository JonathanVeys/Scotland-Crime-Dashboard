## ðŸ“Š Overview

The **Scottish Crime Prediction Dashboard** combines open government data, machine-learning models, and interactive visualisation to explore how crime rates vary across Scotlandâ€™s council areas and wards over time.  

The system automates data ingestion, harmonisation, model training, and dashboard deployment using modern data-science and MLOps practices.

## ðŸš€ Current Features

### ðŸ”¹ Data Engineering
- **Automated ETL pipeline** for downloading, cleaning, and transforming data from:
  - [Scottish Government Open Data](https://statistics.gov.scot/)
  - [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/)
  - [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)
  - [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/)
- **Geospatial harmonisation** between 2017 and 2022 ward boundaries using GeoPandas and shapefile/GeoJSON overlays.
- **Standardised schema** stored in a **Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL** database with versioned data layers (raw â†’ processed â†’ analytical).
- Robust **error-handling, validation, and unit testing** via `pandera`, `pytest`, and CI checks.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis & Modelling
- Exploratory analysis of long-term crime trends by region and type.  
- Time-series and regression-based predictive modelling (e.g. linear regression, random forest, and early neural network prototypes).  
- Evaluation metrics and model comparison tracked via **MLflow**.  
- Configurable experiment scripts for reproducibility.

### ðŸ”¹ Application Layer
- **FastAPI backend** serving pre-processed data and model predictions.  
- **Plotly Dash** frontend providing:
  - Interactive maps (choropleths and point visualisations)
  - Trend plots and statistical summaries
  - Model prediction overlays with confidence intervals
- Deployment planned via **Heroku/Docker** with environment management through `poetry` and `.env` secrets.
